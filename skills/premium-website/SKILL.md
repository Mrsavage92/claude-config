# Premium Website Suite

The premium website suite is the full set of web-* skills that together replace Lovable. It produces Awwwards/Linear/Stripe quality output — not generic AI UI.

**saas-build reads this file once at Phase 0. All rules here apply to every phase automatically. When the suite is updated, only this file needs changing.**

## Cardinal rule — invoke skills, never paraphrase them

Every `/skill-name` reference in this file (and in any phase reference) is a literal **Skill tool invocation directive**, not a "go read the file" instruction. When you see `/web-page`, fire `Skill('web-page')`. When you see `/critique`, fire `Skill('critique')`. When you see `mcp__magic__21st_magic_component_inspiration`, call that MCP tool — do NOT WebSearch and intuit a result.

Reading a SKILL.md and synthesising its output in main context is a **suite-level failure**, not phase completion. It produces output indistinguishable from no skills at all (see AuditHQ v2 retro 2026-04-24). If a Skill tool is unavailable in this environment → HALT and surface NEEDS_HUMAN with the exact missing skill name. Do NOT continue without it. Do NOT delegate to a generic subagent that paraphrases the skill — same failure, different shape.

If a background agent fails (usage limit, timeout, error): the next move is `Skill('X')` directly in main context, NOT main-context self-synthesis.

## Maintenance Rule

Whenever a web-* skill is created or meaningfully updated (new non-negotiable, new MCP call, new checklist item, new pattern), the session that made the change MUST:
1. Update the Skills table below if a new skill was added
2. Update the relevant section in this file AND the relevant reference file in `references/` to reflect the new rule
3. Push both files to GitHub in the same commit

This file is the contract. If a rule lives only in an individual skill file and not here, saas-build will not enforce it.

## Stack Currency (2025) — read before scaffolding

These are breaking or significant changes that affect code generated by this suite. Check package versions before installing.

**Animation — `motion` (was `framer-motion`):**
- Package renamed in v12 (Jan 2025): `npm install motion`
- Import: `from 'motion/react'` — NOT `from 'framer-motion'`
- All skill files in this suite use the correct import. Never revert to `framer-motion`.

**TanStack Query v5 — API changed from v4:**
- `isLoading` → `isPending` on both `useQuery` and `useMutation`
- `cacheTime` → `gcTime`
- `keepPreviousData` → `placeholderData`
- `onSuccess`/`onError`/`onSettled` callbacks removed from `useQuery` — use `useEffect` watching `data`/`error` instead, or handle in `useMutation`
- All overloads removed — single object signature only: `useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn })`
- Codemod available: `npx jscodeshift@latest -t @tanstack/query-v5-codemod`

**Tailwind CSS v4 — if user is on v4:**
- `tailwind.config.js` is gone — config moves to `@theme {}` in CSS
- `@tailwind base/components/utilities` → `@import "tailwindcss"`
- `bg-gradient-to-*` → `bg-linear-to-*`
- Codemod: `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade`
- **This suite targets Tailwind v3 by default.** If the project uses v4, note it in CLAUDE.md and adjust accordingly.

**React 19 (stable Dec 2024) — new patterns available:**
- `use()` hook for async resources and context reading
- Actions API for form handling (replaces manual submit state)
- `useOptimistic()` for optimistic updates (simpler than manual rollback)
- `<Suspense>` improvements — streaming SSR supported natively
- **This suite targets React 18 by default.** React 19 is backward-compatible; use new APIs when they simplify code.

**shadcn/ui — new components (Oct 2025):**
- `Spinner`, `Kbd`, `ButtonGroup`, `InputGroup`, `Field`, `Item`, `Empty` — install via `npx shadcn@latest add`
- Base UI is now an alternative to Radix under the hood — specify if needed: `npx shadcn create`

**Figma Dev Mode MCP — design-to-code (2025 best practice):**
- If the user has Figma designs, connect the Figma Dev Mode MCP before running `/web-design-research`
- It exposes live Figma layer structure directly into context — Claude generates code from the actual design
- Eliminates the gap between design intent and implementation

**Sequential Thinking MCP — for complex architectural decisions:**
- Forces step-by-step reasoning before committing to patterns
- Recommended for Phase 0.5 (design research) and Phase 3 (backend architecture)
- Prevents skipping hard decisions that cause rework in later phases

## Design Refinement Layer (Impeccable Suite)

The impeccable suite operates as a second pass over work the build skills produce. It does not replace them — it sharpens the output.

**When each skill fires in the pipeline:**

| Stage | Trigger | Impeccable skill |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-feature planning | Building a complex feature page | `/shape` — plan before code |
| Start of /web-page | No design context established yet | `/impeccable teach` |
| /web-review Visual Quality < 8/10 | Typography scores Poor | `/typeset` |
| /web-review Visual Quality < 8/10 | Layout/spacing scores Poor | `/layout` |
| /web-review Visual Quality < 8/10 | Color is flat or overused | `/colorize` |
| /web-review Visual Quality < 8/10 | Motion absent or wrong | `/animate` |
| /web-review Visual Quality < 8/10 | Microcopy unclear | `/clarify` |
| /web-review Visual Quality < 8/10 | Design is generic/safe | `/bolder` |
| /web-review Pass D Performance < 8/10 | UI perf issues | `/optimize` |
| /web-review mobile breakpoint failures | Responsive gaps | `/adapt` |
| Before every /web-deploy | Final consistency pass | `/polish` |
| /saas-improve P2 (visual) | Overcrowded or complex UI | `/distill` |
| /saas-improve P2 (visual) | Contrast/density excessive | `/quieter` |
| /saas-improve P3 (delight) | No personality/joy | `/delight` |
| /saas-improve Revenue agent | Generic or weak copy | `/clarify` |

**Invoke `Skill('impeccable')` with `args: 'teach'` once per project to establish design context.** Without it, impeccable skills produce generic output — they need the target audience, brand personality, and use cases to make good decisions. The "teach" mode is mandatory; skipping it is the silent failure mode that wasted weeks of refinement-skill development (AuditHQ v2 retro 2026-04-24).

**Every entry in the table above is a `Skill('X')` tool call when its trigger fires** — not a "consider running" suggestion. If `/web-review` flags Visual Quality < 8/10 with Typography Poor → fire `Skill('typeset')`. If a sub-agent fails → fire the same `Skill()` directly in main context. Self-grading "I would have run typeset but I'll just fix the typography myself" is a phase failure.

## Design DNA

Read `~/.claude/web-system-prompt.md` before any UI generation. It contains:
- Token system (HSL variables only — never hardcoded hex/rgb)
- Typography scale (text-display / text-hero / text-title)
- Color discipline rules
- Visual signature elements (grid lines, grain texture, glow effects)
- Component quality standards

---

## 21st.dev Component Registry

**Every section on a landing page must be sourced from 21st.dev — never invented from scratch.**

Component choices are made ONCE during `/web-design-research` and locked in DESIGN-BRIEF.md as a Component Lock table. Build skills read that table — they do NOT re-run MCP queries.

Full registry table, selection criteria by product type, and adapt rules after component use:
→ Read `references/component-registry.md`

---

## Landing Page Rules

Mandatory sections (in order): [Banner] → Nav → Hero (with animated bg) → Logo Cloud → Stats → Features → Testimonials → Pricing → FAQ → Final CTA → Footer

Non-negotiables enforced on every build: animated background (WebGL blobs, not CSS grid), product visual mockup (shadcn primitives, never a gradient blob), Technique 3 STAGGER hero entrance, logo cloud with InfiniteSlider, CountUp stats section, Features 4 or BentoGrid, TestimonialSlider (min 3), FAQ (min 5 questions), Footer 2 multi-column.

Color discipline: primary color budget = 2 uses per page max. Enterprise design = restraint.

Full section specs, per-page 13-item checklist, two-pass self-review rules, and category-specific overrides (auth pages, SaaS onboarding gate, dashboard pages):
→ Read `references/landing-page-rules.md`

---

## Pre-Deploy Checklist & Performance

No chunk exceeds 250KB gzipped. All routes use React.lazy + Suspense. ProtectedRoute on all auth-gated routes. web-review score 38+/40 before any deploy.

Full 33-item pre-deploy checklist, performance requirements, bundle size rules, deploy rules, routing & auth rules, Webmanifest requirements, testing requirements, and Stripe/payments rules:
→ Read `references/pre-deploy-checklist.md`

---

## Quality Bar

- **Pass threshold**: score >= 38/40 AND pre-deploy checklist fully green
- **Fix loop**: for each failure, run `/web-fix` targeting the exact failure, commit, re-run `/web-review`
- **Hard stop**: after 5 iterations with score still < 38 — log `STUCK` and STOP. Do not proceed to deploy.

Full quality gate loop, page type detection table, dashboard page rules, skill trigger guide, and context refresh rule:
→ Read `references/quality-bar.md`

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Inventing sections from scratch instead of 21st.dev** — every landing page section must come from the registry in `references/component-registry.md`. No exceptions.
- **Skipping per-page self-review** — both passes are required (13-item checklist + 5-question fresh-eyes). Pass 1 alone is not sufficient.
- **Self-grading instead of invoking the skill** — writing "I assessed this 38/40 against the checklist" without firing `Skill('web-review')` is a phase failure, not phase completion. Same for any refinement skill. The transcript MUST contain the tool call.
- **Reading a SKILL.md to "execute its steps inline"** — that is the bypass pattern that produced AuditHQ v2's generic landing. Always invoke via the Skill tool.
- **Deploying without 38/40 quality gate** — `Skill('web-review')` must score 38+ before `Skill('web-deploy')` runs. Never skip or lower the bar.
- **Hardcoded hex/rgb instead of CSS variables** — every color must use `hsl(var(--token))`. Raw Tailwind color classes (`text-gray-500`) must be replaced with semantic tokens (`text-muted-foreground`).
- **Duplicating rules in individual skill files instead of here** — if a rule is not in this file (or its references), saas-build will not enforce it. Individual skill files may elaborate; they must not contradict or replace this contract.

## Full Build Loop

```
saas-build 0.25   → MARKET-BRIEF.md: competitor website deep-dive (hero patterns, social proof format, pricing model), feature gaps, differentiator
/web-design-research → DESIGN-BRIEF.md: reads MARKET-BRIEF.md competitor data, 21st.dev components, LottieFiles, unique color system, multi-page structure
/web-scope        → SCOPE.md — reads DESIGN-BRIEF.md, imports all design decisions, defines page inventory
/web-scaffold     → foundation: config, design system, routes, AppLayout, TrialBanner, Sentry
/web-supabase     → schema, RLS policies, auth, TypeScript types (if backend)
/web-stripe       → checkout session, webhooks, UpgradeButton (if paid plans)
/web-email        → transactional email setup (if email flows required)
/web-page × N     → one page at a time — landing first, auth second, /setup third
                    (dashboard pages: read /dashboard-design first)
                    (list pages: read /web-table first)
/web-rbac         → org roles, team invites, PermissionGate (if multi-user)
/web-storage      → file uploads, buckets, signed URLs (if any file feature)
/web-realtime     → live subscriptions, presence (if live updates needed)
/web-ai           → Claude streaming, cost tracking, chat UI (if AI feature)
/web-analytics    → PostHog setup, event taxonomy (every product)
/web-settings     → /settings page (always required for SaaS with auth)
/web-review       → audit before deploy (38+/40 required)
/web-deploy       → Vercel deploy (Supabase backend, no separate service)
```

Page build order enforced by saas-build:
1. `/` — Landing (non-negotiables apply: animated bg, product mockup, STAGGER hero)
2. `/auth` — Sign in / sign up
3. `/setup` — Onboarding wizard (mandatory for all SaaS with auth)
4. App pages in SCOPE.md priority order
5. `/settings` — Settings (mandatory for all SaaS with auth)

`/web-scope` MUST produce a `SCOPE.md` containing: page list, auth flow diagram, design decisions, color palette choice, component inventory. saas-build uses this as the build contract.

Orchestrated autonomously by `/saas-build`. Update this file when the suite changes — saas-build reads it at Phase 0 and inherits everything automatically.
